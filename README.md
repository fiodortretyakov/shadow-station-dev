# Project: Shadow Station
**Target Platform:** Web / PC (Gamepad Supported)
**Engine:** JavaScript (KAPLAY / Node.js)

## Overview
A 2D "demake" inspired by the mechanics of *Prey (2017)*. The goal is to recreate the tense, atmospheric exploration of a semi-abandoned space station with a focus on:
* **Interactive Environments:** Almost every prop can be picked up, thrown, or searched.
* **Shapeshifting AI:** Shifter-style enemies that camouflage as environmental objects.
* **Player Agency:** Multiple ways to solve puzzles (Gloo, Hacking, or brute force).

## Technical Goals
- Optimized for Chrome browser.
- Full **Gamepad/Controller** integration for a twin-stick feel.
- Lightweight assets to ensure instant loading in-browser.

- [ ] Implement player movement and gamepad mapping.
- [ ] Create invisible collision walls for players Apartment.
- [ ] Script the first "Shifter" chair-to-alien transformation.
